01 - Point in coordinate plane

In the coordinate plane, we have class Point to store a point with it's x-y coordinate.
Your task in this exercise is to implement functions marked with /*  * STUDENT ANSWER   */.
Note: For exercises in Week 1, we have #include <bits/stdc++.h> and using namespace std;

Base code:

class Point
{
private:
    double x, y;

public:
    Point()
    {
        /*  
         * STUDENT ANSWER   
         * TODO: set zero x-y coordinate
         */
    }

    Point(double x, double y)
    {
        /*  
         * STUDENT ANSWER
         */
    }

    void setX(double x)
    {
        /*  
         * STUDENT ANSWER
         */
    }

    void setY(double y)
    {
        /*  
         * STUDENT ANSWER
         */
    }

    double getX() const
    {
        /*  
         * STUDENT ANSWER
         */
    }

    double getY() const
    {
        /*  
         * STUDENT ANSWER
         */
    }

    double distanceToPoint(const Point& pointA)
    {
        /*  
         * STUDENT ANSWER   
         * TODO: calculate the distance from this point to point A in the coordinate plane
         */
    }
};
